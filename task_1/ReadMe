1. For the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), i seperated the code into different piece, the model for handind data model, 
The viewmodel for getting data from teh service and passing it to the model, and the view only handles rendering the user interface
2. For DRY (Don't RepeatYourself), i create a generalTextDisplay widget to handle displaying text and to prevent repetition of the widget allover the view, this will ensure, if 
for example a the application font is changes, since all the text is handled by one widget, it can be changed for the generalTextDisplay widget and it will be effected across the whole application
