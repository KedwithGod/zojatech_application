Branching Strategy: Git Workflow for Multi-Developer Projects
When working on a large project with multiple developers, I’ve found that maintaining code quality and stability is key.
 One strategy that’s really helped my team achieve this is the Gitflow Workflow. It’s a branching strategy that makes collaboration smoother, keeps our codebase stable, and helps us hit our deadlines without sacrificing quality.

1. Branch Types
In Gitflow, we mainly use five types of branches:

Main (master or main) Branch:

This is where the production-ready code lives.
We only release official versions from this branch.
It’s crucial that this branch stays stable, so no one pushes directly to it.
Codes only go to it after they have passed the test, and code reviews

Develop Branch:

The develop branch is our playground for integrating features.
It’s where we put all the latest changes that are still in development.
Once a feature branch is merged into develop, it goes through testing.


Feature Branches:
These branches are created off of develop.
Each one focuses on a single feature or task.
We usually name them feature/<feature-name>. e.g feature-ked
After finishing a feature, we merge it back into develop, assuming it passes the developer's own tests and code reveiew


Release Branches:

When we have a set of features ready for release, we create a release branch from develop.
This branch is for final testing and last-minute bug fixes.
We name them release/<version-number>.
Once it’s stable, we merge it into both main and develop.
Hotfix Branches:

Hotfixes are for critical issues in production, created directly from main.
These branches allow us to address urgent problems without disrupting the ongoing work in develop.
We name them hotfix/<issue-description>.
After applying the fix and testing it, we merge the branch back into both main and develop.

Conclusion
The Gitflow Workflow branching strategy, combined with thorough code reviews and CI pipelines, has been a game-changer for managing complex projects with multiple developers. 
It keeps our codebase stable, makes releases predictable, and allows us to work efficiently without stepping on each other’s toes.
This approach has not only improved the quality of our code but also reduced the stress around release times. 
For release we use tools like codemagic that build the code directly from a github branch whenever it is ready for relase
